# SentraSoc
SentraSOC is a containerized, simulated Security Operations Center (SOC) that detects MITRE-mapped cyber threats in real-time. It uses Docker-based microservices for attack simulation, behavioral detection, and dashboard triage. All threat activity is safely simulated for demo and learning purposes.
