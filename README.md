#  SentraSOC

**SentraSOC** is a containerized, simulated Security Operations Center (SOC) platform that detects real-time cyber threats mapped to the [MITRE ATT&CK framework](https://attack.mitre.org/). It is designed for hands-on learning, detection engineering, and cybersecurity demo environments using safely simulated attack traffic.

---

##  Project Overview

SentraSOC is composed of three modular Docker containers:
- **threat-detector**: Monitors logs and behaviors to generate real-time alerts
- **soc-dashboard**: A browser-based triage UI that maps alerts to MITRE techniques
- **soc-demo-contr**: Simulates adversarial behaviors like DNS tunneling and privilege escalation

All components communicate over isolated ports and simulate a working SOC pipeline.

---

##  Key Features

-  **Real-Time Alerting** – Behavioral detection engine processes live log events
-  **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping** – Each alert is tagged with corresponding TTPs (e.g., T1548, T1005)
-  **SOC Dashboard** – Displays alert severity, types (Behavioral, DNS), timestamps, and triage options
-  **Containerized Microservices** – Built with Docker for reproducibility and portability
-  **Educational Use** – Safe, offline environment ideal for blue team training or interviews

##  Simulated Threat Types

| Threat Type              | MITRE Technique | Description |
|--------------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| DNS Tunneling            | T1041           | Simulated C2 beaconing to `evil.com`, `botnet-controller.biz` |
| Privilege Escalation     | T1548           | Emulates shell commands or root-level access |
| Multi-Stage Attack Flow  | T1190 → T1005   | Shows progression from exploitation to data access |
| Script Execution         | T1059           | Python and shell command triggers with anomalous behavior |

>  _All attacks are **simulated** and meant for safe lab/demonstration use only._
